Description:	(RW) Read returns value of the Heartbeat update period.
		Write to the file changes this period value.

		This period should reflect planned polling interval of device
		health status. High frequency Heartbeat monitoring wastes CPU cycles
		but minimizes the customerâ€™s system downtime. Also, if there are
		large service requests that take some time to complete, high frequency
		Heartbeat monitoring could result in false reports of unresponsiveness
		and in those cases, period needs to be increased.

		This parameter is effective only for c3xxx, c62x, dh895xcc devices.
		4xxx has this value internally fixed to 200ms.

		Default value is set to 500. Minimal allowed value is 200.
		All values are expressed in milliseconds.

Description:	(RO) Read returns the device health status.

		Returns 0 when device is healthy or -1 when is unresponsive
		or the query failed to send.

		The driver does not monitor for Heartbeat. It is left for a user
		to poll the status periodically.
