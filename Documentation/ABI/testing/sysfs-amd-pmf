Description:	Reading this file tells if the AMD Platform Management(PMF)
		Cool n Quiet Framework(CnQF) feature is enabled or not.

		This feature is not enabled by default and gets only turned on
		if OEM BIOS passes a "flag" to PMF ACPI function (index 11 or 12)
		or in case the user writes "on".

		To turn off CnQF user can write "off" to the sysfs node.
		Note: Systems that support auto mode will not have this sysfs file
		available.
