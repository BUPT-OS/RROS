KernelVersion:	5.19
Contact:	Linux kernel mailing list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Description:
		Attribute group to describe the capabilities exposed
		for a particular pmu. Each attribute of this group can
		expose information specific to a PMU, say pmu_name, so that
		userspace can understand some of the feature which the
		platform specific PMU supports.

		One of the example available capability in supported platform
		like Intel is pmu_name, which exposes underlying CPU name known
		to the PMU driver.

		Example output in powerpc:
		grep . /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/caps/*
		/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/caps/pmu_name:POWER9
