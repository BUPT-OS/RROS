Description:
		Reading returns a list with the possible filter modes.

		  * "sinc4"       - Sinc 4. Excellent noise performance. Long
                    1st conversion time. No natural 50/60Hz rejection.

		  * "sinc4+sinc1" - Sinc4 + averaging by 8. Low 1st conversion
		    time.

		  * "sinc3"	      - Sinc3. Moderate 1st conversion time.
		    Good noise performance.

		  * "sinc3+rej60" - Sinc3 + 60Hz rejection. At a sampling
		    frequency of 50Hz, achieves simultaneous 50Hz and 60Hz
		    rejection.

		  * "sinc3+sinc1" - Sinc3 + averaging by 8. Low 1st conversion
		    time. Best used with a sampling frequency of at least
		    216.19Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf1"   - Sinc3 + Post Filter 1. 53dB rejection @
		    50Hz, 58dB rejection @ 60Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf2"   - Sinc3 + Post Filter 2. 70dB rejection @
		    50Hz, 70dB rejection @ 60Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf3"   - Sinc3 + Post Filter 3. 99dB rejection @
		    50Hz, 103dB rejection @ 60Hz.

		  * "sinc3+pf4"   - Sinc3 + Post Filter 4. 103dB rejection @
		    50Hz, 109dB rejection @ 60Hz.

Description:
		Set the filter mode of the differential channel. When the filter
		mode changes, the in_voltageY-voltageZ_sampling_frequency and
		in_voltageY-voltageZ_sampling_frequency_available attributes
		might also change to accommodate the new filter mode.
		If the current sampling frequency is out of range for the new
		filter mode, the sampling frequency will be changed to the
		closest valid one.
