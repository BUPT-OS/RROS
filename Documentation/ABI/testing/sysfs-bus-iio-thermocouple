What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/fault_ovuv
KernelVersion:	5.1
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Overvoltage or Undervoltage Input Fault. The internal circuitry
		is protected from excessive voltages applied to the thermocouple
		cables. The device can also detect if such a condition occurs.

		Reading returns '1' if input voltage is negative or greater
		than VDD, otherwise '0'.
