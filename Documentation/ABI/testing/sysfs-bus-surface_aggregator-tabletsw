Description:
		This attribute returns a string with the current type-cover
		or device posture, as indicated by the embedded controller.
		Currently returned posture states are:

		- "disconnected": The type-cover has been disconnected.

		- "closed": The type-cover has been folded closed and lies on
		  top of the display.

		- "laptop": The type-cover is open and in laptop-mode, i.e.,
		  ready for normal use.

		- "folded-canvas": The type-cover has been folded back
		  part-ways, but does not lie flush with the back side of the
		  device. In general, this means that the kick-stand is used
		  and extended atop of the cover.

		- "folded-back": The type cover has been fully folded back and
		  lies flush with the back side of the device.

		- "<unknown>": The current state is unknown to the driver, for
		  example due to newer as-of-yet unsupported hardware.

		New states may be introduced with new hardware. Users therefore
		must not rely on this list of states being exhaustive and
		gracefully handle unknown states.

Description:
		This attribute returns a string with the current device posture, as indicated by the embedded controller. Currently
		returned posture states are:

		- "closed": The lid of the device is closed.

		- "laptop": The lid of the device is opened and the device
		  operates as a normal laptop.

		- "slate": The screen covers the keyboard or has been flipped
		  back and the device operates mainly based on touch input.

		- "tablet": The device operates as tablet and exclusively
		  relies on touch input (or external peripherals).

		- "<unknown>": The current state is unknown to the driver, for
		  example due to newer as-of-yet unsupported hardware.

		New states may be introduced with new hardware. Users therefore
		must not rely on this list of states being exhaustive and
