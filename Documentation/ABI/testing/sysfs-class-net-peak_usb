Description:
		PEAK PCAN-USB devices support user-configurable CAN channel
		identifiers. Contrary to a USB serial number, these identifiers
		are writable and can be set per CAN interface. This means that
		if a USB device exports multiple CAN interfaces, each of them
		can be assigned a unique channel ID.
		This attribute provides read-only access to the currently
		configured value of the channel identifier. Depending on the
		device type, the identifier has a length of 8 or 32 bit. The
		value read from this attribute is always an 8 digit 32 bit
		hexadecimal value in big endian format. If the device only
		supports an 8 bit identifier, the upper 24 bit of the value are
		set to zero.
