Description:
		This entry allows enabling the sysoff mode of rt9467 charger
		devices.
		If enabled and the input is removed, the internal battery FET
		is turned off to reduce the leakage from the BAT pin. See
		device datasheet for details. It's commonly used when the
		product enter shipping stage. After entering shipping mode,
		only 'VBUS' or 'Power key" pressed can make it leave this mode.
		'Disable' also can help to leave it, but it's more like to
		abort the action before the device really enter shipping mode.
