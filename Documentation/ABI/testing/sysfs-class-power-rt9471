Contact:	ChiYuan Huang <cy_huang@richtek.com>
Description:
		This entry allows enabling the sysoff mode of rt9471 charger devices.
		If enabled and the input is removed, the internal battery FET is turned
		off to reduce the leakage from the BAT pin. See device datasheet for details.
		It's commonly used when the product enter shipping stage. After entering
		shipping mode, only 'VBUS' or 'Power key" pressed can make it leave this
		mode. 'Disable' also can help to leave it, but it's more like to abort
		the action before the device really enter shipping mode.
