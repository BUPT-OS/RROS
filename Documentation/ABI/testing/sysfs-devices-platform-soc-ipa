KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/ directory contains
		attributes that define IDs associated with IPA
		endpoints.  The "rx" or "tx" in an endpoint name is
		from the perspective of the AP.  An endpoint ID is a
		small unsigned integer.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_rx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_rx file contains
		the ID of the AP endpoint on which packets originating
		from the embedded modem are received.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_tx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/modem_tx file contains
		the ID of the AP endpoint on which packets destined
		for the embedded modem are sent.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/monitor_rx
Date:		July 2022
KernelVersion:	v5.19
Contact:	Alex Elder <elder@kernel.org>
Description:
		The .../XXXXXXX.ipa/endpoint_id/monitor_rx file contains
		the ID of the AP endpoint on which IPA "monitor" data is
		received.  The monitor endpoint supplies replicas of
		packets that enter the IPA hardware for processing.
		Each replicated packet is preceded by a fixed-size "ODL"
		header (see .../XXXXXXX.ipa/feature/monitor, above).
		Large packets are truncated, to reduce the bandwidth
		required to provide the monitor function.

What:		.../XXXXXXX.ipa/modem/
