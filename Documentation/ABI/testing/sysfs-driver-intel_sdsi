Description:
		This directory contains interface files for accessing Intel
		On Demand (formerly Software Defined Silicon or SDSi) features
		on a CPU. X represents the socket instance (though not the
		socket ID). The socket ID is determined by reading the
		registers file and decoding it per the specification.

		Some files communicate with On Demand hardware through a
		mailbox. Should the operation fail, one of the following error
		codes may be returned:

		==========	=====
		Error Code	Cause
		==========	=====
		EIO		General mailbox failure. Log may indicate cause.
		EBUSY		Mailbox is owned by another agent.
		EPERM		On Demand capability is not enabled in hardware.
		EPROTO		Failure in mailbox protocol detected by driver.
				See log for details.
		EOVERFLOW	For provision commands, the size of the data
				exceeds what may be written.
		ESPIPE		Seeking is not allowed.
		ETIMEDOUT	Failure to complete mailbox transaction in time.

Date:		Feb 2022
KernelVersion:	5.18
Contact:	"David E. Box" <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(WO) Used to write an Authentication Key Certificate (AKC) to
		the On Demand NVRAM for the CPU. The AKC is used to authenticate
		a Capability Activation Payload. Mailbox command.

What:		/sys/bus/auxiliary/devices/intel_vsec.sdsi.X/provision_cap
Date:		Feb 2022
KernelVersion:	5.18
Contact:	"David E. Box" <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(WO) Used to write a Capability Activation Payload (CAP) to the
		On Demand NVRAM for the CPU. CAPs are used to activate a given
		CPU feature. A CAP is validated by On Demand hardware using a
		previously provisioned AKC file. Upon successful authentication,
		the CPU configuration is updated. A cold reboot is required to
		fully activate the feature. Mailbox command.

KernelVersion:	6.2
Contact:	"David E. Box" <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) Used to read back the current meter certificate for the CPU
		from Intel On Demand hardware. The meter certificate contains
		utilization metrics of On Demand enabled features. Mailbox
		command.
