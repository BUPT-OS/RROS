Date:		Mar 2022
Contact:	SeongJae Park <sj@kernel.org>
Description:	Writing 'on' or 'off' to this file makes the kdamond starts or

		based on the current status.  Writing 'commit' to this file
		makes the kdamond reads the user inputs in the sysfs files
		except 'state' again.  Writing 'update_schemes_stats' to the
		file updates contents of schemes stats files of the kdamond.
		Writing 'update_schemes_tried_regions' to the file updates
		contents of 'tried_regions' directory of every scheme directory
		of this kdamond.  Writing 'update_schemes_tried_bytes' to the
		file updates only '.../tried_regions/total_bytes' files of this
		kdamond.  Writing 'clear_schemes_tried_regions' to the file
		removes contents of the 'tried_regions' directory.
