What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/sma2
What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/sma3
What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/sma4
Date:		September 2021
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) These attributes specify the direction of the signal
		on the associated SMA connectors, and also the signal sink
		or source.

		The display format of the attribute is a space separated
		list of signals, prefixed by the input/output direction.

		The signal direction may be changed (if supported) by
		prefixing the signal list with either "in:" or "out:".
		If neither prefix is present, then the direction is unchanged.

		The output signal may be changed by writing one of the listed
		values from the available_sma_outputs attribute set.

		The input destinations may be changed by writing multiple
		values from the available_sma_inputs attribute set,
		separated by spaces.  If there are duplicated input
		destinations between connectors, the lowest numbered SMA
		connector is given priority.

		Note that not all input combinations may make sense.

		The 10Mhz reference clock input is currently only valid
		on SMA1 and may not be combined with other destination sinks.

What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/tod_correction
Date:		March 2022
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) The incoming GNSS signal is in UTC time, and the NMEA
		format messages do not provide a TAI offset.  This sets the
		correction value for the incoming time.

		If UBX_LS is enabled, this should be 0, and the offset is
		taken from the UBX-NAV-TIMELS message.

What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/ts_window_adjust
Date:		September 2021
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) When retrieving the PHC with the PTP SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED
		ioctl, a system timestamp is made before and after the PHC
		time is retrieved.  The midpoint between the two system
		timestamps is usually taken to be the SYS time associated
		with the PHC time.  This estimate may be wrong, as it depends
		on PCI latencies, and when the PHC time was latched

		The attribute value reduces the end timestamp by the given
		number of nanoseconds, so the computed midpoint matches the
		retrieved PHC time.

		The initial value is set based on measured PCI latency and
		the estimated point where the FPGA latches the PHC time.  This
		value may be changed by writing an unsigned integer.

What:		/sys/class/timecard/ocpN/utc_tai_offset
Date:		September 2021
Contact:	Jonathan Lemon <jonathan.lemon@gmail.com>
Description:	(RW) The DCF and IRIG output signals are in UTC, while the
		TimeCard operates on TAI.  This attribute allows setting the
		offset in seconds, which is added to the TAI timebase for
		these formats.

		The offset may be changed by writing an unsigned integer.
