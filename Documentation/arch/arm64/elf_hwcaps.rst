ARM64 ELF hwcaps
================

This document describes the usage and semantics of the arm64 ELF hwcaps.


1. Introduction
---------------

Some hardware or software features are only available on some CPU
implementations, and/or with certain kernel configurations, but have no
architected discovery mechanism available to userspace code at EL0. The
kernel exposes the presence of these features to userspace through a set
of flags called hwcaps, exposed in the auxiliary vector.

Userspace software can test for features by acquiring the AT_HWCAP or
AT_HWCAP2 entry of the auxiliary vector, and testing whether the relevant
flags are set, e.g.::

	bool floating_point_is_present(void)
	{
		unsigned long hwcaps = getauxval(AT_HWCAP);
		if (hwcaps & HWCAP_FP)
			return true;

		return false;
	}

Where software relies on a feature described by a hwcap, it should check
the relevant hwcap flag to verify that the feature is present before
attempting to make use of the feature.

Features cannot be probed reliably through other means. When a feature
is not available, attempting to use it may result in unpredictable
behaviour, and is not guaranteed to result in any reliable indication
that the feature is unavailable, such as a SIGILL.


2. Interpretation of hwcaps
---------------------------

The majority of hwcaps are intended to indicate the presence of features
which are described by architected ID registers inaccessible to
userspace code at EL0. These hwcaps are defined in terms of ID register
fields, and should be interpreted with reference to the definition of
these fields in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual (ARM ARM).

Such hwcaps are described below in the form::

    Functionality implied by idreg.field == val.

Such hwcaps indicate the availability of functionality that the ARM ARM
defines as being present when idreg.field has value val, but do not
indicate that idreg.field is precisely equal to val, nor do they
indicate the absence of functionality implied by other values of
idreg.field.

Other hwcaps may indicate the presence of features which cannot be
described by ID registers alone. These may be described without
reference to ID registers, and may refer to other documentation.
