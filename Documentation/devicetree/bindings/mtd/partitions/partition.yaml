title: Partition

description: |
  This binding describes a single flash partition. Each partition must have its
  relative offset and size specified. Depending on partition function extra
  properties can be used.

  A partition may be dynamically allocated by a specific parser at runtime.
  In this specific case, a specific suffix is required to the node name.
  Everything after 'partition-' will be used as the partition name to compare
  with the one dynamically allocated by the specific parser.
  If the partition contains invalid char a label can be provided that will
  be used instead of the node name to make the comparison.
  This is used to assign an OF node to the dynamiccally allocated partition
  so that subsystem like NVMEM can provide an OF node and declare NVMEM cells.
  The OF node will be assigned only if the partition label declared match the
  one assigned by the parser at runtime.

    description: The label / name for this partition. If omitted, the label
      is taken from the node name (excluding the unit address).

  read-only:
    description: This parameter, if present, is a hint that this partition
      should only be mounted read-only. This is usually used for flash
      partitions containing early-boot firmware images or data which should
      not be clobbered.
