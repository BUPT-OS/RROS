title: Microchip PolarFire SoC (MPFS) MSS (microprocessor subsystem) system controller

description: |
  PolarFire SoC devices include a microcontroller acting as the system controller,
  which provides "services" to the main processor and to the FPGA fabric. These
  services include hardware rng, reprogramming of the FPGA and verification of the
  eNVM contents etc. More information on these services can be found online, at
  https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1409CF11-8EF9-4C24-A94E-70979A688632-en-US-1/index.html

  Communication with the system controller is done via a mailbox, of which the client
  portion is documented here.
