description:
  The PMIC GLINK service, running on a coprocessor on some modern Qualcomm
  platforms and implement USB Type-C handling and battery management. This
  binding describes the component in the OS used to communicate with the
  firmware and connect it's resources to those described in the Devicetree,
  particularly the USB Type-C controllers relationship with USB and DisplayPort
  components.
