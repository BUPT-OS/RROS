description: |
  In Tegra186, the BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor) implements
  an interface that is used to read system temperatures, including CPU
  cluster and GPU temperatures. This binding describes the thermal
  sensor that is exposed by BPMP.

  The BPMP thermal node must be located directly inside the main BPMP
  node. See ../firmware/nvidia,tegra186-bpmp.yaml for details of the
  BPMP binding.

  This node represents a thermal sensor. See

    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal-sensor.yaml

  for details of the core thermal binding.
