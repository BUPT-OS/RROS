Introduction
------------

Intel(R) Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (DPTF) is a platform
level hardware/software solution for power and thermal management.

As a container for multiple power/thermal technologies, DPTF provides
a coordinated approach for different policies to effect the hardware
state of a system.

Since it is a platform level framework, this has several components.
Some parts of the technology is implemented in the firmware and uses
ACPI and PCI devices to expose various features for monitoring and
control. Linux has a set of kernel drivers exposing hardware interface
to user space. This allows user space thermal solutions like
"Linux Thermal Daemon" to read platform specific thermal and power
tables to deliver adequate performance while keeping the system under
thermal limits.

DPTF Processor thermal RFIM interface
--------------------------------------------

RFIM interface allows adjustment of FIVR (Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator),
DDR (Double Data Rate) and DLVR (Digital Linear Voltage Regulator)
frequencies to avoid RF interference with WiFi and 5G.

Switching voltage regulators (VR) generate radiated EMI or RFI at the
fundamental frequency and its harmonics. Some harmonics may interfere
with very sensitive wireless receivers such as Wi-Fi and cellular that
are integrated into host systems like notebook PCs.  One of mitigation
methods is requesting SOC integrated VR (IVR) switching frequency to a
small % and shift away the switching noise harmonic interference from
radio channels.  OEM or ODMs can use the driver to control SOC IVR
operation within the range where it does not impact IVR performance.

Some products use DLVR instead of FIVR as switching voltage regulator.
In this case attributes of DLVR must be adjusted instead of FIVR.

While shifting the frequencies additional clock noise can be introduced,
which is compensated by adjusting Spread spectrum percent. This helps
to reduce the clock noise to meet regulatory compliance. This spreading
% increases bandwidth of signal transmission and hence reduces the
effects of interference, noise and signal fading.

DRAM devices of DDR IO interface and their power plane can generate EMI
at the data rates. Similar to IVR control mechanism, Intel offers a
mechanism by which DDR data rates can be changed if several conditions
are met: there is strong RFI interference because of DDR; CPU power
management has no other restriction in changing DDR data rates;
PC ODMs enable this feature (real time DDR RFI Mitigation referred to as
DDR-RFIM) for Wi-Fi from BIOS.
