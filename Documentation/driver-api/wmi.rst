WMI Driver API
==============

The WMI driver core supports a more modern bus-based interface for interacting
with WMI devices, and an older GUID-based interface. The latter interface is
considered to be deprecated, so new WMI drivers should generally avoid it since
it has some issues with multiple WMI devices and events sharing the same GUIDs
and/or notification IDs. The modern bus-based interface instead maps each
WMI device to a :c:type:`struct wmi_device <wmi_device>`, so it supports
WMI devices sharing GUIDs and/or notification IDs. Drivers can then register
a :c:type:`struct wmi_driver <wmi_driver>`, which will be bound to compatible
WMI devices by the driver core.
