 * 0: No VM_BIND support.
 *
 * 1: In VM_UNBIND calls, the UMD must specify the exact mappings created
 *    previously with VM_BIND, the ioctl will not support unbinding multiple
 *    mappings or splitting them. Similarly, VM_BIND calls will not replace
 *    any existing mappings.
 *
 * 2: The restrictions on unbinding partial or multiple mappings is
 *    lifted, Similarly, binding will replace any mappings in the given range.

 * The @start, @offset and @length must be 4K page aligned. However the DG2
