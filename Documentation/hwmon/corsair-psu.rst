Description
-----------

This driver implements the sysfs interface for the Corsair PSUs with a HID protocol
interface of the HXi and RMi series.
These power supplies provide access to a micro-controller with 2 attached
temperature sensors, 1 fan rpm sensor, 4 sensors for volt levels, 4 sensors for
power usage and 4 sensors for current levels and additional non-sensor information
like uptimes.

Usage Notes
-----------

It is an USB HID device, so it is auto-detected, supports hot-swapping and
several devices at once.

Flickering values in the rail voltage levels can be an indicator for a failing
PSU. Accordingly to the default automatic fan speed plan the fan starts at about
30% of the wattage rating. If this does not happen, a fan failure is likely. The
driver also provides some additional useful values via debugfs, which do not fit
into the hwmon class.
