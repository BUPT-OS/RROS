Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Renesas HS3001 chips, a humidity
and temperature family. Temperature is measured in degrees celsius, relative
humidity is expressed as a percentage. In the sysfs interface, all values are
scaled by 1000, i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500.

The device communicates with the I2C protocol. Sensors have the I2C
address 0x44 by default.
