Description
-----------

The TPS546D24A is a highly integrated, non-isolated DC/DC converter capable
of high frequency operation and 40-A current output from a 7-mm x 5-mm
package.

Two, three, and four TPS546D24A devices can be interconnected
to provide up to 160 A on a single output. The device has an option to
overdrive the internal 5-V LDO with an external 5-V supply via the VDD5
pin to improve efficiency and reduce power dissipation of the converter.
