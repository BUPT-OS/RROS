The Linux Kernel documentation
==============================

This is the top level of the kernel's documentation tree.  Kernel
documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress;
that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the
documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if
you want to help out.

Working with the development community
======================================

The essential guides for interacting with the kernel's development
community and getting your work upstream.

User-oriented documentation
===========================

The following manuals are written for *users* of the kernel â€” those who are
trying to get it to work optimally on a given system and application
developers seeking information on the kernel's user-space APIs.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   admin-guide/index
   The kernel build system <kbuild/index>
   admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst

The following holds information on the kernel's expectations regarding the
platform firmwares.

Other documentation
===================

There are several unsorted documents that don't seem to fit on other parts
of the documentation body, or may require some adjustments and/or conversion
to ReStructured Text format, or are simply too old.
