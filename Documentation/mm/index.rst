Memory Management Guide
=======================

This is a guide to understanding the memory management subsystem
of Linux.  If you are looking for advice on simply allocating memory,
see the :ref:`memory_allocation`.  For controlling and tuning guides,
see the :doc:`admin guide <../admin-guide/mm/index>`.

Legacy Documentation
====================

This is a collection of older documents about the Linux memory management
(MM) subsystem internals with different level of details ranging from
notes and mailing list responses for elaborating descriptions of data
structures and algorithms.  It should all be integrated nicely into the
above structured documentation, or deleted if it has served its purpose.
