=============================
Flexcan CAN Controller driver

On/off RTR frames reception
===========================

For most flexcan IP cores the driver supports 2 RX modes:

- FIFO
- mailbox

The older flexcan cores (integrated into the i.MX25, i.MX28, i.MX35
and i.MX53 SOCs) only receive RTR frames if the controller is
configured for RX-FIFO mode.

The RX FIFO mode uses a hardware FIFO with a depth of 6 CAN frames,
while the mailbox mode uses a software FIFO with a depth of up to 62
CAN frames. With the help of the bigger buffer, the mailbox mode
performs better under high system load situations.

As reception of RTR frames is part of the CAN standard, all flexcan
cores come up in a mode where RTR reception is possible.

With the "rx-rtr" private flag the ability to receive RTR frames can
be waived at the expense of losing the ability to receive RTR
messages. This trade off is beneficial in certain use cases.

"rx-rtr" on
  Receive RTR frames. (default)

  The CAN controller can and will receive RTR frames.

  On some IP cores the controller cannot receive RTR frames in the
  more performant "RX mailbox" mode and will use "RX FIFO" mode
  instead.

"rx-rtr" off

  Waive ability to receive RTR frames. (not supported on all IP cores)

  This mode activates the "RX mailbox mode" for better performance, on
  some IP cores RTR frames cannot be received anymore.

The setting can only be changed if the interface is down::

    ip link set dev can0 down
    ethtool --set-priv-flags can0 rx-rtr {off|on}
    ip link set dev can0 up
