Overview
========

There are several counter groups based on where the counter is being counted. In
addition, each group of counters may have different counter types.

These counter groups are based on which component in a networking setup,
illustrated below, that they describe::

Groups
======

Ring
  Software counters populated by the driver stack.

Netdev
  An aggregation of software ring counters.

vPort counters
  Traffic counters and drops due to steering or no buffers. May indicate issues
  with NIC. These counters include Ethernet traffic counters (including Raw
  Ethernet) and RDMA/RoCE traffic counters.

Physical port counters
  Counters that collect statistics about the PFs and VFs. May indicate issues
  with NIC, link, or network. This measuring point holds information on
  standardized counters like IEEE 802.3, RFC2863, RFC 2819, RFC 3635 and
  additional counters like flow control, FEC and more. Physical port counters
  are not exposed to virtual machines.

Priority Port Counters
  A set of the physical port counters, per priority per port.

Types
=====

Counters are divided into three types.

Traffic Informative Counters
  Counters which count traffic. These counters can be used for load estimation
  or for general debug.

Traffic Acceleration Counters
  Counters which count traffic that was accelerated by Mellanox driver or by
  hardware. The counters are an additional layer to the informative counter set,
  and the same traffic is counted in both informative and acceleration counters.

.. [#accel] Traffic acceleration counter.

Error Counters
  Increment of these counters might indicate a problem. Each of these counters
  has an explanation and correction action.

Statistic can be fetched via the `ip link` or `ethtool` commands. `ethtool`
provides more detailed information.::

    ip â€“s link show <if-name>
    ethtool -S <if-name>

Descriptions
============

XSK, PTP, and QoS counters that are similar to counters defined previously will
not be separately listed. For example, `ptp_tx[i]_packets` will not be
explicitly documented since `tx[i]_packets` describes the behavior of both
counters, except `ptp_tx[i]_packets` is only counted when precision time
protocol is used.

Ring / Netdev Counter
----------------------------
The following counters are available per ring or software port.

These counters provide information on the amount of traffic that was accelerated
by the NIC. The counters are counting the accelerated traffic in addition to the
standard counters which counts it (i.e. accelerated traffic is counted twice).

The counter names in the table below refers to both ring and port counters. The
notation for ring counters includes the [i] index without the braces. The
notation for port counters doesn't include the [i]. A counter name
`rx[i]_packets` will be printed as `rx0_packets` for ring 0 and `rx_packets` for
the software port.

       If this counter is increasing, it implies that the network is congested
       and cannot absorb the traffic coming from the adapter. Note: This counter
       is available only if PFC was enabled on priority p.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_pause_duration`
     - The duration of pause received (in microSec) on priority p on the
       physical port. The counter represents the time the port did not send any
       traffic on this priority. If this counter is increasing, it implies that
       the network is congested and cannot absorb the traffic coming from the
       adapter. Note: This counter is available only if PFC was enabled on
       priority p.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_pause_transition`
     - The number of times a transition from Xoff to Xon on priority p on the
       physical port has occurred. Note: This counter is available only if PFC
       was enabled on priority p.
     - Informative

   * - `tx_prio[p]_pause`
     - The number of pause packets transmitted on priority p on a physical port.
       If this counter is increasing, it implies that the adapter is congested
       and cannot absorb the traffic coming from the network. Note: This counter
       is available only if PFC was enabled on priority p.
     - Informative

   * - `tx_prio[p]_pause_duration`
     - The duration of pause transmitter (in microSec) on priority p on the
       physical port. Note: This counter is available only if PFC was enabled on
       priority p.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_buf_discard`
     - The number of packets discarded by device due to lack of per host receive
       buffers.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_cong_discard`
     - The number of packets discarded by device due to per host congestion.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_marked`
     - The number of packets ecn marked by device due to per host congestion.
     - Informative

   * - `rx_prio[p]_discards`
     - The number of packets discarded by device due to lack of receive buffers.
     - Informative

Device Counters

   :widths: 2 3 1

   * - Counter
     - Description
     - Type

   * - `rx_pci_signal_integrity`
     - Counts physical layer PCIe signal integrity errors, the number of
       transitions to recovery due to Framing errors and CRC (dlp and tlp). If
       this counter is raising, try moving the adapter card to a different slot
       to rule out a bad PCI slot. Validate that you are running with the latest
       firmware available and latest server BIOS version.
     - Error

   * - `tx_pci_signal_integrity`
     - Counts physical layer PCIe signal integrity errors, the number of
       transition to recovery initiated by the other side (moving to recovery
       due to getting TS/EIEOS). If this counter is raising, try moving the
       adapter card to a different slot to rule out a bad PCI slot. Validate
       that you are running with the latest firmware available and latest server
       BIOS version.
     - Error

   * - `outbound_pci_buffer_overflow`
     - The number of packets dropped due to pci buffer overflow. If this counter
       is raising in high rate, it might indicate that the receive traffic rate
       for a host is larger than the PCIe bus and therefore a congestion occurs.
     - Informative

   * - `outbound_pci_stalled_rd`
     - The percentage (in the range 0...100) of time within the last second that
       the NIC had outbound non-posted reads requests but could not perform the
       operation due to insufficient posted credits.
     - Informative

   * - `outbound_pci_stalled_wr`
     - The percentage (in the range 0...100) of time within the last second that
       the NIC had outbound posted writes requests but could not perform the
       operation due to insufficient posted credits.
     - Informative

   * - `outbound_pci_stalled_rd_events`
     - The number of seconds where `outbound_pci_stalled_rd` was above 30%.
     - Informative

   * - `outbound_pci_stalled_wr_events`
     - The number of seconds where `outbound_pci_stalled_wr` was above 30%.
     - Informative

   * - `dev_out_of_buffer`
     - The number of times the device owned queue had not enough buffers
       allocated.
     - Error
