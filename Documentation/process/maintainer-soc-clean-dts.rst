SoC Platforms with DTS Compliance Requirements
==============================================

Overview
--------

SoC platforms or subarchitectures should follow all the rules from
Documentation/process/maintainer-soc.rst.  This document referenced in
MAINTAINERS impose additional requirements listed below.

Strict DTS DT Schema and dtc Compliance
---------------------------------------

No changes to the SoC platform Devicetree sources (DTS files) should introduce
new ``make dtbs_check W=1`` warnings.  Warnings in a new board DTS, which are
results of issues in an included DTSI file, are considered existing, not new
warnings.  The platform maintainers have automation in place which should point
out any new warnings.

If a commit introducing new warnings gets accepted somehow, the resulting
issues shall be fixed in reasonable time (e.g. within one release) or the
commit reverted.
