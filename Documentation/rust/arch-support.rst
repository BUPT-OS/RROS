Arch Support
============

Currently, the Rust compiler (``rustc``) uses LLVM for code generation,
which limits the supported architectures that can be targeted. In addition,
support for building the kernel with LLVM/Clang varies (please see
Documentation/kbuild/llvm.rst). This support is needed for ``bindgen``
which uses ``libclang``.

Below is a general summary of architectures that currently work. Level of
support corresponds to ``S`` values in the ``MAINTAINERS`` file.
