E-MU Digital Audio System mixer / default DSP code
==================================================

This document covers the E-MU 0404/1010/1212/1616/1820 PCI/PCI-e/CardBus
cards.

These cards use regular EMU10K2 (SoundBlaster Audigy) chips, but with an
alternative front-end geared towards semi-professional studio recording.

This document is based on audigy-mixer.rst.


Hardware compatibility
======================

The EMU10K2 chips have a very short capture FIFO, which makes recording
unreliable if the card's PCI bus requests are not handled with the
appropriate priority.
This is the case on more modern motherboards, where the PCI bus is only a
secondary peripheral, rather than the actual arbiter of device access.
In particular, I got recording glitches during simultaneous playback on an
Intel DP55 board (memory controller in the CPU), but had success with an
Intel DP45 board (memory controller in the north bridge).

The PCI Express variants of these cards (which have a PCI bridge on board,
but are otherwise identical) may be less problematic.


Driver capabilities
===================

This driver supports only 16-bit 44.1/48 kHz operation. The multi-channel
device (see emu10k1-jack.rst) additionally supports 24-bit capture.

A patchset to enhance the driver is available from `a GitHub repository
<https://github.com/ossilator/linux/tree/ossis-emu10k1>`_.
Its multi-channel device supports 24-bit for both playback and capture,
and also supports full 88.2/96/176.4/192 kHz operation.
It is not going to be upstreamed due to a fundamental disagreement about
what constitutes a good user experience.


Digital mixer controls
======================

Note that the controls work as attenuators: the maximum value is the neutral
position leaving the signal unchanged. Note that if the same destination is
mentioned in multiple controls, the signal is accumulated and can be clipped
(set to maximal or minimal value without checking for overflow).

Explanation of used abbreviations:

DAC
	digital to analog converter
ADC
	analog to digital converter
LFE
	low frequency effects (used as subwoofer signal)
IEC958
	S/PDIF
FX-bus
	the EMU10K2 chip has an effect bus containing 64 accumulators.
	Each of the synthesizer voices can feed its output to these accumulators
	and the DSP microcontroller can operate with the resulting sum.

name='Clock Source',index=0

name='PCM Front Playback Volume',index=0
----------------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from left and right front PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 8 and 9 for left and right front PCM
samples for 5.1 playback. The result samples are forwarded to the DSP 0 & 1
playback channels.

name='PCM Surround Playback Volume',index=0
-------------------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from left and right surround PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 2 and 3 for left and right surround PCM
samples for 5.1 playback. The result samples are forwarded to the DSP 2 & 3
playback channels.

name='PCM Side Playback Volume',index=0
---------------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from left and right side PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 14 and 15 for left and right side PCM
samples for 7.1 playback. The result samples are forwarded to the DSP 6 & 7
playback channels.

name='PCM Center Playback Volume',index=0
-----------------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from the center PCM FX-bus accumulator.
ALSA uses accumulator 6 for center PCM samples for 5.1 playback. The result samples
are forwarded to the DSP 4 playback channel.

name='PCM LFE Playback Volume',index=0
--------------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from the LFE PCM FX-bus accumulator.
ALSA uses accumulator 7 for LFE PCM samples for 5.1 playback. The result samples
are forwarded to the DSP 5 playback channel.

name='PCM Playback Volume',index=0
----------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM samples for
stereo playback. The result samples are forwarded to the virtual stereo mixer.

name='PCM Capture Volume',index=0
---------------------------------
This control is used to attenuate samples from left and right PCM FX-bus
accumulators. ALSA uses accumulators 0 and 1 for left and right PCM.
The result is forwarded to the standard capture PCM device.

name='Music Playback Volume',index=0
