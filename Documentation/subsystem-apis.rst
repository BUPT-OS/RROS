Kernel subsystem documentation
==============================

These books get into the details of how specific kernel subsystems work
from the point of view of a kernel developer.  Much of the information here
is taken directly from the kernel source, with supplemental material added
as needed (or at least as we managed to add it â€” probably *not* all that is
needed).

**Fixme**: much more organizational work is needed here.
