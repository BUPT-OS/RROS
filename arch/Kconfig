	select KALLSYMS
	select TASKS_RCU if PREEMPTION
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config JUMP_LABEL
	bool "Optimize very unlikely/likely branches"
	depends on HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL
	select OBJTOOL if HAVE_JUMP_LABEL_HACK
	help
	  This option enables a transparent branch optimization that
	  makes certain almost-always-true or almost-always-false branch
	  conditions even cheaper to execute within the kernel.

	  Certain performance-sensitive kernel code, such as trace points,
	  scheduler functionality, networking code and KVM have such
	  branches and include support for this optimization technique.

	  If it is detected that the compiler has support for "asm goto",
	  the kernel will compile such branches with just a nop
	  instruction. When the condition flag is toggled to true, the
	  nop will be converted to a jump instruction to execute the
	  conditional block of instructions.

	  This technique lowers overhead and stress on the branch prediction
	  of the processor and generally makes the kernel faster. The update
	  of the condition is slower, but those are always very rare.

	  ( On 32-bit x86, the necessary options added to the compiler
	    flags may increase the size of the kernel slightly. )

config UPROBES
	def_bool n
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_UPROBES
	help
	  Uprobes is the user-space counterpart to kprobes: they
	  enable instrumentation applications (such as 'perf probe')
	  to establish unintrusive probes in user-space binaries and
	  libraries, by executing handler functions when the probes
	  are hit by user-space applications.

	  ( These probes come in the form of single-byte breakpoints,
	    managed by the kernel and kept transparent to the probed
	    application. )

config HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS
	def_bool 64BIT && !HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	help
	  Some architectures require 64 bit accesses to be 64 bit
	  aligned, which also requires structs containing 64 bit values
	  to be 64 bit aligned too. This includes some 32 bit
	  architectures which can do 64 bit accesses, as well as 64 bit
	  architectures without unaligned access.

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if 64 bit
	  accesses are required to be 64 bit aligned in this way even
	  though it is not a 64 bit architecture.

	  See Documentation/core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst for
	  more information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP
	bool
	help
	  Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions
	  for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old
	  inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the
	  __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's
	  happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In
	  particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap
	  with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or
	  store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It
	  should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the
	  hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it
	  does, the use of the builtins is optional.

	  Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap
	  instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it
	  on architectures that don't have such instructions.

	  This option turns on the "stack-protector" GCC feature. This

	  overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added if they
	  have an 8-byte or larger character array on the stack.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector").
