 *	MM Cache Management
 *	===================
 *
 *	The arch/arm64/mm/cache.S implements these methods.
 *
 *	Start addresses are inclusive and end addresses are exclusive; start
 *	addresses should be rounded down, end addresses up.
 *
 *	See Documentation/core-api/cachetlb.rst for more information. Please note that
 *	the implementation assumes non-aliasing VIPT D-cache and (aliasing)
 *	VIPT I-cache.
 *
 *	All functions below apply to the interval [start, end)
 *		- start  - virtual start address (inclusive)
 *		- end    - virtual end address (exclusive)
 *
 *	caches_clean_inval_pou(start, end)
 *
 *		Ensure coherency between the I-cache and the D-cache region to
 *		the Point of Unification.
 *
 *	caches_clean_inval_user_pou(start, end)
 *
 *		Ensure coherency between the I-cache and the D-cache region to
 *		the Point of Unification.
 *		Use only if the region might access user memory.
 *
 *	icache_inval_pou(start, end)
 *
 *		Invalidate I-cache region to the Point of Unification.
 *
 *	dcache_clean_inval_poc(start, end)
 *
 *		Clean and invalidate D-cache region to the Point of Coherency.
 *
 *	dcache_inval_poc(start, end)
 *
 *		Invalidate D-cache region to the Point of Coherency.
 *
 *	dcache_clean_poc(start, end)
 *
 *		Clean D-cache region to the Point of Coherency.
 *
 *	dcache_clean_pop(start, end)
 *
 *		Clean D-cache region to the Point of Persistence.
 *
 *	dcache_clean_pou(start, end)
 *
 *		Clean D-cache region to the Point of Unification.
