	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run other

	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

	  Support hosting fully virtualized guest machines using hardware
	  virtualization extensions.  You will need a fairly recent
	  processor equipped with virtualization extensions. You will also
	  need to select one or more of the processor modules below.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Provides support for KVM on processors equipped with Intel's VT
	  extensions, a.k.a. Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX).

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called kvm-intel.

config X86_SGX_KVM
	bool "Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) Virtualization"
	depends on X86_SGX && KVM_INTEL
	help

	  Enables KVM guests to create SGX enclaves.

	  This includes support to expose "raw" unreclaimable enclave memory to
	  guests via a device node, e.g. /dev/sgx_vepc.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Provides support for launching Encrypted VMs (SEV) and Encrypted VMs
	  with Encrypted State (SEV-ES) on AMD processors.

config KVM_SMM
	bool "System Management Mode emulation"
	default y
	depends on KVM
	help
	  Provides support for KVM to emulate System Management Mode (SMM)
	  in virtual machines.  This can be used by the virtual machine
	  firmware to implement UEFI secure boot.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config KVM_XEN
	bool "Support for Xen hypercall interface"
	depends on KVM
	help
	  Provides KVM support for the hosting Xen HVM guests and
	  passing Xen hypercalls to userspace.

	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

	help
	  Enables runtime assertions in KVM's MMU that are too costly to enable
	  in anything remotely resembling a production environment, e.g. this
	  gates code that verifies a to-be-freed page table doesn't have any
	  present SPTEs.
