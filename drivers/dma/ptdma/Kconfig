	  Enable support for the AMD PTDMA controller. This controller
	  provides DMA capabilities to perform high bandwidth memory to
	  memory and IO copy operations. It performs DMA transfer through
	  queue-based descriptor management. This DMA controller is intended
	  to be used with AMD Non-Transparent Bridge devices and not for
	  general purpose peripheral DMA.
