	  Enable this to use unified memory and managed memory in HIP. This
	  memory manager supports two modes of operation. One based on
	  preemptions and one based on page faults. To enable page fault
	  based memory management on most GFXv9 GPUs, set the module
	  parameter amdgpu.noretry=0.

	help
	  Enable peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between AMD GPUs over
	  the PCIe bus. This can improve performance of multi-GPU compute
	  applications and libraries by enabling GPUs to access data directly
	  in peer GPUs' memory without intermediate copies in system memory.

	  This P2P feature is only enabled on compatible chipsets, and between
	  GPUs with large memory BARs that expose the entire VRAM in PCIe bus
	  address space within the physical address limits of the GPUs.
