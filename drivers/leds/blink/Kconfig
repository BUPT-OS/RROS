	  This option enables support for LED controller that is part of
	  BCM63138 SoC. The same hardware block is known to be also used
	  in BCM4908, BCM6848, BCM6858, BCM63148, BCM63381 and BCM68360.

	  If compiled as module it will be called leds-bcm63138.

         This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines on
         Lightning Mountain (LGM) SoC. Lightning Mountain is a AnyWAN
         gateway-on-a-chip SoC to be shipped on mid and high end home
         gateways and routers.

         These LEDs are driven by a Serial Shift Output (SSO) controller.
         The driver supports hardware blinking and the LEDs can be configured
         to be triggered by software/CPU or by hardware.

         Say 'Y' here if you are working on LGM SoC based platform. Otherwise,
         say 'N'. To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
         will be called leds-lgm-sso.
