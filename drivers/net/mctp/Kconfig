	  This driver provides an MCTP-over-serial interface, through a
	  serial line-discipline, as defined by DMTF specification "DSP0253 -
	  MCTP Serial Transport Binding". By attaching the ldisc to a serial
	  device, we get a new net device to transport MCTP packets.

	  This allows communication with external MCTP endpoints which use
	  serial as their transport. It can also be used as an easy way to
	  provide MCTP connectivity between virtual machines, by forwarding
	  data between simple virtual serial devices.

	  Say y here if you need to connect to MCTP endpoints over serial. To
	  compile as a module, use m; the module will be called mctp-serial.

config MCTP_TRANSPORT_I2C

	select MCTP_FLOWS
	help
	  Provides a driver to access MCTP devices over SMBus/I2C transport,
	  from DMTF specification DSP0237. A MCTP protocol network device is
	  created for each I2C bus that has been assigned a mctp-i2c device.
