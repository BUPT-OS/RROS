/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * iwlmei is the kernel module that is in charge of the communication between
 * the iwlwifi driver and the CSME firmware's WLAN driver. This communication
 * uses the SAP protocol defined in another file.
 * iwlwifi can request or release ownership on the WiFi device through iwlmei.
 * iwlmei may notify iwlwifi about certain events: what filter iwlwifi should
 * use to passthrough inbound packets to the CSME firmware for example. iwlmei
 * may also use iwlwifi to send traffic. This means that we need communication
 * from iwlmei to iwlwifi and the other way around.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Life cycle
 *
 * iwlmei exports symbols that are needed by iwlwifi so that iwlmei will always
 * be loaded when iwlwifi is alive. iwlwifi registers itself to iwlmei and
 * provides the pointers to the functions that iwlmei calls whenever needed.
 * iwlwifi calls iwlmei through direct and context-free function calls.
 * It is assumed that only one device is accessible to the CSME firmware and
 * under the scope of iwlmei so that it is valid not to have any context passed
 * to iwlmei's functions.
 *
 * There are cases in which iwlmei can't access the CSME firmware, because the
 * CSME firmware is undergoing a reset, or the mei bus decided to unbind the
 * device. In those cases, iwlmei will need not to send requests over the mei
 * bus. Instead, it needs to cache the requests from iwlwifi and fulfill them
 * when the mei bus is available again.
 *
 * iwlmei can call iwlwifi as long as iwlwifi is registered to iwlmei. When
 * iwlwifi goes down (the PCI device is unbound, or the iwlwifi is unloaded)
 * iwlwifi needs to unregister from iwlmei.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Memory layout
 *
 * Since iwlwifi calls iwlmei without any context, iwlmei needs to hold a
 * global pointer to its data (which is in the mei client device's private
 * data area). If there was no bind on the mei bus, this pointer is NULL and
 * iwlmei knows not access to the CSME firmware upon requests from iwlwifi.
 *
 * iwlmei needs to cache requests from iwlwifi when there is no mei client
 * device available (when iwlmei has been removed from the mei bus). In this
 * case, all iwlmei's data that resides in the mei client device's private data
 * area is unavailable. For this specific case, a separate caching area is
 * needed.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Concurrency
 *
 * iwlwifi can call iwlmei at any time. iwlmei will take care to synchronize
 * the calls from iwlwifi with its internal flows. iwlwifi must not call iwlmei
 * in flows that cannot sleep. Moreover, iwlwifi must not call iwlmei in flows
 * that originated from iwlmei.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Probe and remove from mei bus driver
 *
 * When the mei bus driver enumerates its devices, it calls the iwlmei's probe
 * function which will send the %SAP_ME_MSG_START message. The probe completes
 * before the response (%SAP_ME_MSG_START_OK) is received. This response will
 * be handle by the Rx path. Once it arrives, the connection to the CSME
 * firmware is considered established and iwlwifi's requests can be treated
 * against the CSME firmware.
 *
 * When the mei bus driver removes the device, iwlmei loses all the data that
 * was attached to the mei client device. It clears the global pointer to the
 * mei client device since it is not available anymore. This will cause all the
 * requests coming from iwlwifi to be cached. This flow takes the global mutex
 * to be synchronized with all the requests coming from iwlwifi.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Driver load when CSME owns the device
 *
 * When the driver (iwlwifi) is loaded while CSME owns the device,
 * it'll ask CSME to release the device through HW registers. CSME
 * will release the device only in the case that there is no connection
 * through the mei bus. If there is a mei bus connection, CSME will refuse
 * to release the ownership on the device through the HW registers. In that
 * case, iwlwifi must first request ownership using the SAP protocol.
 *
 * Once iwlwifi will request ownership through the SAP protocol, CSME will
 * grant the ownership on the device through the HW registers as well.
 * In order to request ownership over SAP, we first need to have an interface
 * which means that we need to register to mac80211.
 * This can't happen before we get the NVM that contains all the capabilities
 * of the device. Reading the NVM usually requires the load the firmware, but
 * this is impossible as long as we don't have ownership on the device.
 * In order to solve this chicken and egg problem, the host driver can get
 * the NVM through CSME which owns the device. It can send
 * %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_GET_NVM, which will be replied by %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_NVM with
 * the NVM's content that the host driver needs.
 */

/**
 * DOC: CSME behavior regarding the ownership requests
 *
 * The ownership requests from the host can come in two different ways:
 *  - the HW registers in iwl_pcie_set_hw_ready
 *  - using the Software Arbitration Protocol (SAP)
 *
 * The host can ask CSME who owns the device with %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_WHO_OWNS_NIC,
 * and it can request ownership with %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_HOST_ASKS_FOR_NIC_OWNERSHIP.
 * The host will first use %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_WHO_OWNS_NIC to know what state
 * CSME is in. In case CSME thinks it owns the device, the host can ask for
 * ownership with %SAP_MSG_NOTIF_HOST_ASKS_FOR_NIC_OWNERSHIP.
 *
 * Here the table that describes CSME's behavior upon ownership request:
 *
 * +-------------------+------------+--------------+-----------------------------+------------+

/**
 * DOC: Driver load when CSME is associated and a session is active
 *
 * A "session" is active when CSME is associated to an access point and the
 * link is used to attach a remote driver or to control the system remotely.
 * When a session is active, we want to make sure it won't disconnect when we
 * take ownership on the device.
 * In this case, the driver can get the device, but it'll need to make
 * sure that it'll connect to the exact same AP (same BSSID).
 * In order to do so, CSME will send the connection parameters through
 * SAP and then the host can check if it can connect to this same AP.
 * If yes, it can request ownership through SAP and connect quickly without
 * scanning all the channels, but just probing the AP on the channel that
 * CSME was connected to.
 * In order to signal this specific scenario to iwlwifi, iwlmei will
 * immediately require iwlwifi to report RF-Kill to the network stack. This
 * RF-Kill will prevent the stack from getting the device, and it has a reason
 * that tells the userspace that the device is in RF-Kill because it is not
 * owned by the host. Once the userspace has configured the right profile,
 * it'll be able to let iwlmei know that it can request ownership over SAP
 * which will remove the RF-Kill, and finally allow the host to connect.
 * The host has then 3 seconds to connect (including DHCP). Had the host
 * failed to connect within those 3 seconds, CSME will take the device back.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Datapath
 *
 * CSME can transmit packets, through the netdev that it gets from the wifi
 * driver. It'll send packet in the 802.3 format and simply call
 * dev_queue_xmit.
 *
 * For Rx, iwlmei registers a Rx handler that it attaches to the netdev. iwlmei
 * may catch packets and send them to CSME, it can then either drop them so
 * that they are invisible to user space, or let them go the user space.
 *
 * Packets transmitted by the user space do not need to be forwarded to CSME
 * with the exception of the DHCP request. In order to know what IP is used
 * by the user space, CSME needs to get the DHCP request. See
 * iwl_mei_tx_copy_to_csme().
