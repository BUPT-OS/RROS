	help
	  The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
	  connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
	  don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvme.

config NVME_MULTIPATH
	bool "NVMe multipath support"
	depends on NVME_CORE
	help
	   This option enables support for multipath access to NVMe
	   subsystems.  If this option is enabled only a single
	   /dev/nvmeXnY device will show up for each NVMe namespace,
	   even if it is accessible through multiple controllers.

config NVME_VERBOSE_ERRORS
	bool "NVMe verbose error reporting"
	depends on NVME_CORE
	help
	   This option enables verbose reporting for NVMe errors. The
	   error translation table will grow the kernel image size by
	   about 4 KB.

config NVME_HWMON
	bool "NVMe hardware monitoring"
	depends on (NVME_CORE=y && HWMON=y) || (NVME_CORE=m && HWMON)
	help
	  This provides support for NVMe hardware monitoring. If enabled,
	  a hardware monitoring device will be created for each NVMe drive
	  in the system.

	help
	  This provides support for the NVMe over Fabrics protocol using
	  the RDMA (Infiniband, RoCE, iWarp) transport.  This allows you
	  to use remote block devices exported using the NVMe protocol set.

	  To configure a NVMe over Fabrics controller use the nvme-cli tool
	  from https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This provides support for the NVMe over Fabrics protocol using
	  the FC transport.  This allows you to use remote block devices
	  exported using the NVMe protocol set.

	  To configure a NVMe over Fabrics controller use the nvme-cli tool
	  from https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli.
