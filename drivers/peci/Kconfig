	  The Platform Environment Control Interface (PECI) is an interface
	  that provides a communication channel to Intel processors and
	  chipset components from external monitoring or control devices.

	  If you are building a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) kernel
	  for Intel platform say Y here and also to the specific driver for
	  your adapter(s) below. If unsure say N.

	  This support is also available as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci.

	select AUXILIARY_BUS
	help
	  This option enables peci-cpu driver for Intel processors. It is
	  responsible for creating auxiliary devices that can subsequently
	  be used by other drivers in order to perform various
	  functionalities such as e.g. temperature monitoring.

	  Additional drivers must be enabled in order to use the functionality
	  of the device.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci-cpu.
