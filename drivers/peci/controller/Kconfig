	  This option enables PECI controller driver for ASPEED AST2400,
	  AST2500 and AST2600 SoCs. It allows BMC to discover devices
	  connected to it, and communicate with them using PECI protocol.

	  Say Y here if your system runs on ASPEED SoC and you are using it
	  as BMC for Intel platform.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will
	  be called peci-aspeed.

	  This option enables PECI controller driver for Nuvoton NPCM7XX
	  and NPCM8XX SoCs. It allows BMC to discover devices connected
	  to it and communicate with them using PECI protocol.

	  Say Y here if you want support for the Platform Environment Control
	  Interface (PECI) bus adapter driver on the Nuvoton NPCM SoCs.

	  This support is also available as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci-npcm.
