	  Enable support for the In Field Scan capability in select
	  CPUs. The capability allows for running low level tests via
	  a scan image distributed by Intel via Github to validate CPU
	  operation beyond baseline RAS capabilities. To compile this
	  support as a module, choose M here. The module will be called
	  intel_ifs.

	  If unsure, say N.
