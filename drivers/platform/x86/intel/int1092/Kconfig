	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This driver helps to limit the exposure of human body to RF frequency by
	  providing information to userspace application that will inform the Intel
	  M.2 modem to regulate the RF power based on SAR data obtained from the
	  sensors captured in the BIOS. ACPI interface exposes this data from the BIOS
	  to SAR driver. The front end application in userspace will interact with SAR
	  driver to obtain information like the device mode, Antenna index, baseband index,
	  SAR table index and use available communication like MBIM interface to enable
	  data communication to modem for RF power regulation. Enable this config when
	  given platform needs to support "Dynamic SAR" configuration for a modem available
	  on the platform.
