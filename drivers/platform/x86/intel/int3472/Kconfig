	  This driver adds power controller support for the Intel SkyCam
	  devices found on the Intel SkyLake platforms.

	  The INT3472 is a camera power controller, a logical device found on
	  Intel Skylake-based systems that can map to different hardware
	  devices depending on the platform. On machines designed for Chrome OS
	  it maps to a TPS68470 camera PMIC. On machines designed for Windows,
	  it maps to either a TP68470 camera PMIC, a uP6641Q sensor PMIC, or a
	  set of discrete GPIOs and power gates.

	  If your device was designed for Chrome OS, this driver will provide
	  an ACPI OpRegion, which must be available before any of the devices
	  using it are probed. For this reason, you should select Y if your
	  device was designed for ChromeOS. For the same reason the
	  I2C_DESIGNWARE_PLATFORM option must be set to Y too.

	  Say Y or M here if you have a SkyLake device designed for use
	  with Windows or ChromeOS. Say N here if you are not sure.

	  The module will be named "intel-skl-int3472".
