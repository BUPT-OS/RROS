 *
 * Limitations:
 * - If the IP block is configured without "shadow registers", all register
 *   writes will take effect immediately, causing glitches on the output.
 *   If shadow registers *are* enabled, setting the "SYNC_UPDATE" register
 *   notifies the core that it needs to update the registers defining the
 *   waveform from the contents of the "shadow registers". Otherwise, changes
 *   will take effective immediately, even for those channels.
 *   As setting the period/duty cycle takes 4 register writes, there is a window
 *   in which this races against the start of a new period.
 * - The IP block has no concept of a duty cycle, only rising/falling edges of
 *   the waveform. Unfortunately, if the rising & falling edges registers have
 *   the same value written to them the IP block will do whichever of a rising
 *   or a falling edge is possible. I.E. a 50% waveform at twice the requested
 *   period. Therefore to get a 0% waveform, the output is set the max high/low
 *   time depending on polarity.
 *   If the duty cycle is 0%, and the requested period is less than the
 *   available period resolution, this will manifest as a ~100% waveform (with
 *   some output glitches) rather than 50%.
 * - The PWM period is set for the whole IP block not per channel. The driver
 *   will only change the period if no other PWM output is enabled.
