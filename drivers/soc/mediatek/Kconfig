	select MTK_INFRACFG
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Command Queue (CMDQ)
	  driver. The CMDQ is used to help read/write registers with critical
	  time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
	  vblank.

config MTK_DEVAPC
	tristate "Mediatek Device APC Support"
	help
	  Say yes here to enable support for Mediatek Device APC driver.
	  This driver is mainly used to handle the violation which catches
	  unexpected transaction.
	  The violation information is logged for further analysis or
	  countermeasures.

config MTK_INFRACFG
	bool "MediaTek INFRACFG Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek INFRACFG controller. The
	  INFRACFG controller contains various infrastructure registers not
	  directly associated to any device.

config MTK_PMIC_WRAP
	tristate "MediaTek PMIC Wrapper Support"
	depends on RESET_CONTROLLER
	depends on OF
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for MediaTek PMIC Wrapper found
	  on different MediaTek SoCs. The PMIC wrapper is a proprietary
	  hardware to connect the PMIC.

	  Say y here to enable power domain support.
	  In order to meet high performance and low power requirements, the System
	  Control Processor System (SCPSYS) has several power management related
	  tasks in the system.

	depends on NVMEM_MTK_EFUSE && NVMEM
	help
	  The Smart Voltage Scaling(SVS) engine is a piece of hardware
	  which has several controllers(banks) for calculating suitable
	  voltage to different power domains(CPU/GPU/CCI) according to
	  chip process corner, temperatures and other factors. Then DVFS
	  driver could apply SVS bank voltage to PMIC/Buck.
