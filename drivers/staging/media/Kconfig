	  This option allows you to select a number of media drivers that
	  don't have the "normal" Linux kernel quality level.
	  Most of them don't follow properly the V4L, DVB and/or RC API's,
	  so, they won't likely work fine with the existing applications.
	  That also means that, once fixed, their API's will change to match
	  the existing ones.

	  If you wish to work on these drivers, to help improve them, or
	  to report problems you have with them, please use the
	  linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

	  If in doubt, say N here.
