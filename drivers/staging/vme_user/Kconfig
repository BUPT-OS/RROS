	 If you say Y here you get support for the Tundra TSI148 VME bridge
	 chip.

config VME_FAKE
	tristate "Fake"
	help
	 If you say Y here you get support for the fake VME bridge. This
	 provides a virtualised VME Bus for devices with no VME bridge. This
	 is mainly useful for VME development (in the absence of VME
	 hardware).

config VME_USER
	tristate "VME user space access driver"
	help
	  If you say Y here you want to be able to access a limited number of
	  VME windows in a manner at least semi-compatible with the interface
	  provided with the original driver at <http://www.vmelinux.org/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will
	  be called vme_user. If unsure, say N.
