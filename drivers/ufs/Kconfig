	  Enables support for UFS (Universal Flash Storage) host controllers.
	  A UFS host controller is an electronic component that is able to
	  communicate with a UFS card. UFS host controllers occur in
	  smartphones, laptops, digital cameras and also in cars.
	  The kernel module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.rst>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.
