	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a USB2VGA dongle based on a
	  Net2280 and a SiS315 chip.

	  Note that this device requires a USB 2.0 host controller. It will not
	  work with USB 1.x controllers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module will be
	  called sisusbvga. If unsure, say N.
