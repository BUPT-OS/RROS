config FIRMWARE_EDID
	bool "Enable firmware EDID"
	depends on FB
	help
	  This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
	  On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
	  transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
	  nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.

	  In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
	  experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
	  something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
	  combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
	  suffer from this problem.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want the legacy /dev/fb* device file and
	  interfaces within sysfs anc procfs. It is only required if you
	  have userspace programs that depend on fbdev for graphics output.
	  This does not affect the framebuffer console. If unsure, say N.

	  Allow generic frame-buffer functions to work on displays with 1, 2

	  byte order to bytes in long order.

config FB_SYS_FILLRECT

	  This menu will let you enable support for the framebuffers with
	  non-native endianness (e.g. Little-Endian framebuffer on a
	  Big-Endian machine). Most probably you don't have such hardware,
	  so it's safe to say "n" here.

	depends on FB
	help
	  This enables functions for handling video modes using the
	  Generalized Timing Formula and the EDID parser. A few drivers rely
	  on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If
	  your driver does not take advantage of this feature, choosing Y will
	  just increase the kernel size by about 5K.

config FB_TILEBLITTING
	bool "Enable Tile Blitting Support"
	depends on FB
	help
	  This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	  where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	  the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	  default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	  parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	  For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	  an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	  rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	  terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	  This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	  unsure, say N.
