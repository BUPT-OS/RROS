 * Queued spinlock
 *
 * A 'generic' spinlock implementation that is based on MCS locks. For an
 * architecture that's looking for a 'generic' spinlock, please first consider
 * ticket-lock.h and only come looking here when you've considered all the
 * constraints below and can show your hardware does actually perform better
 * with qspinlock.
 *
 * qspinlock relies on atomic_*_release()/atomic_*_acquire() to be RCsc (or no
 * weaker than RCtso if you're power), where regular code only expects atomic_t
 * to be RCpc.
 *
 * qspinlock relies on a far greater (compared to asm-generic/spinlock.h) set
 * of atomic operations to behave well together, please audit them carefully to
 * ensure they all have forward progress. Many atomic operations may default to
 * cmpxchg() loops which will not have good forward progress properties on
 * LL/SC architectures.
 *
 * One notable example is atomic_fetch_or_acquire(), which x86 cannot (cheaply)
 * do. Carefully read the patches that introduced
 * queued_fetch_set_pending_acquire().
 *
 * qspinlock also heavily relies on mixed size atomic operations, in specific
 * it requires architectures to have xchg16; something which many LL/SC
 * architectures need to implement as a 32bit and+or in order to satisfy the
 * forward progress guarantees mentioned above.
