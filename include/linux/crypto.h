 * @cia_setkey: Set key for the transformation. This function is used to either
 *	        program a supplied key into the hardware or store the key in the
 *	        transformation context for programming it later. Note that this
 *	        function does modify the transformation context. This function
 *	        can be called multiple times during the existence of the
 *	        transformation object, so one must make sure the key is properly
 *	        reprogrammed into the hardware. This function is also
 *	        responsible for checking the key length for validity.
 * @cia_encrypt: Encrypt a single block. This function is used to encrypt a
 *		 single block of data, which must be @cra_blocksize big. This
 *		 always operates on a full @cra_blocksize and it is not possible
 *		 to encrypt a block of smaller size. The supplied buffers must
 *		 therefore also be at least of @cra_blocksize size. Both the
 *		 input and output buffers are always aligned to @cra_alignmask.
 *		 In case either of the input or output buffer supplied by user
 *		 of the crypto API is not aligned to @cra_alignmask, the crypto
 *		 API will re-align the buffers. The re-alignment means that a
 *		 new buffer will be allocated, the data will be copied into the
 *		 new buffer, then the processing will happen on the new buffer,
 *		 then the data will be copied back into the original buffer and
 *		 finally the new buffer will be freed. In case a software
 *		 fallback was put in place in the @cra_init call, this function
 *		 might need to use the fallback if the algorithm doesn't support
 *		 all of the key sizes. In case the key was stored in
 *		 transformation context, the key might need to be re-programmed
 *		 into the hardware in this function. This function shall not
 *		 modify the transformation context, as this function may be
 *		 called in parallel with the same transformation object.
 * @cia_decrypt: Decrypt a single block. This is a reverse counterpart to
 *		 @cia_encrypt, and the conditions are exactly the same.

 * @cra_flags: Flags describing this transformation. See include/linux/crypto.h
 *	       CRYPTO_ALG_* flags for the flags which go in here. Those are
 *	       used for fine-tuning the description of the transformation
 *	       algorithm.
 * @cra_blocksize: Minimum block size of this transformation. The size in bytes
 *		   of the smallest possible unit which can be transformed with
 *		   this algorithm. The users must respect this value.
 *		   In case of HASH transformation, it is possible for a smaller
 *		   block than @cra_blocksize to be passed to the crypto API for
 *		   transformation, in case of any other transformation type, an
 * 		   error will be returned upon any attempt to transform smaller
 *		   than @cra_blocksize chunks.
 * @cra_ctxsize: Size of the operational context of the transformation. This
 *		 value informs the kernel crypto API about the memory size
 *		 needed to be allocated for the transformation context.
 * @cra_alignmask: Alignment mask for the input and output data buffer. The data
 *		   buffer containing the input data for the algorithm must be
 *		   aligned to this alignment mask. The data buffer for the
 *		   output data must be aligned to this alignment mask. Note that
 *		   the Crypto API will do the re-alignment in software, but
 *		   only under special conditions and there is a performance hit.
 *		   The re-alignment happens at these occasions for different
 *		   @cra_u types: cipher -- For both input data and output data
 *		   buffer; ahash -- For output hash destination buf; shash --
 *		   For output hash destination buf.
 *		   This is needed on hardware which is flawed by design and
 *		   cannot pick data from arbitrary addresses.
 * @cra_priority: Priority of this transformation implementation. In case
 *		  multiple transformations with same @cra_name are available to
 *		  the Crypto API, the kernel will use the one with highest
 *		  @cra_priority.
 * @cra_name: Generic name (usable by multiple implementations) of the
 *	      transformation algorithm. This is the name of the transformation
 *	      itself. This field is used by the kernel when looking up the
 *	      providers of particular transformation.
 * @cra_driver_name: Unique name of the transformation provider. This is the
 *		     name of the provider of the transformation. This can be any
 *		     arbitrary value, but in the usual case, this contains the
 *		     name of the chip or provider and the name of the
 *		     transformation algorithm.
 * @cra_type: Type of the cryptographic transformation. This is a pointer to
 *	      struct crypto_type, which implements callbacks common for all
 *	      transformation types. There are multiple options, such as
 *	      &crypto_skcipher_type, &crypto_ahash_type, &crypto_rng_type.
 *	      This field might be empty. In that case, there are no common
 *	      callbacks. This is the case for: cipher, compress, shash.
 * @cra_u: Callbacks implementing the transformation. This is a union of
 *	   multiple structures. Depending on the type of transformation selected
 *	   by @cra_type and @cra_flags above, the associated structure must be
 *	   filled with callbacks. This field might be empty. This is the case
 *	   for ahash, shash.
 * @cra_init: Initialize the cryptographic transformation object. This function
 *	      is used to initialize the cryptographic transformation object.
 *	      This function is called only once at the instantiation time, right
 *	      after the transformation context was allocated. In case the
 *	      cryptographic hardware has some special requirements which need to
 *	      be handled by software, this function shall check for the precise
 *	      requirement of the transformation and put any software fallbacks
 *	      in place.
 * @cra_exit: Deinitialize the cryptographic transformation object. This is a
 *	      counterpart to @cra_init, used to remove various changes set in
 *	      @cra_init.
 * @cra_u.cipher: Union member which contains a single-block symmetric cipher
 *		  definition. See @struct @cipher_alg.
 * @cra_u.compress: Union member which contains a (de)compression algorithm.
 *		    See @struct @compress_alg.
 * @cra_module: Owner of this transformation implementation. Set to THIS_MODULE
 * @cra_list: internally used
 * @cra_users: internally used
 * @cra_refcnt: internally used
 * @cra_destroy: internally used
 *
 * The struct crypto_alg describes a generic Crypto API algorithm and is common
 * for all of the transformations. Any variable not documented here shall not
 * be used by a cipher implementation as it is internal to the Crypto API.
