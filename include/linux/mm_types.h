/*
 * Each physical page in the system has a struct page associated with
 * it to keep track of whatever it is we are using the page for at the
 * moment. Note that we have no way to track which tasks are using
 * a page, though if it is a pagecache page, rmap structures can tell us
 * who is mapping it.
 *
 * If you allocate the page using alloc_pages(), you can use some of the
 * space in struct page for your own purposes.  The five words in the main
 * union are available, except for bit 0 of the first word which must be
 * kept clear.  Many users use this word to store a pointer to an object
 * which is guaranteed to be aligned.  If you use the same storage as
 * page->mapping, you must restore it to NULL before freeing the page.
 *
 * If your page will not be mapped to userspace, you can also use the four
 * bytes in the mapcount union, but you must call page_mapcount_reset()
 * before freeing it.
 *
 * If you want to use the refcount field, it must be used in such a way
 * that other CPUs temporarily incrementing and then decrementing the
 * refcount does not cause problems.  On receiving the page from
 * alloc_pages(), the refcount will be positive.
 *
 * If you allocate pages of order > 0, you can use some of the fields
 * in each subpage, but you may need to restore some of their values
 * afterwards.
 *
 * SLUB uses cmpxchg_double() to atomically update its freelist and counters.
 * That requires that freelist & counters in struct slab be adjacent and
 * double-word aligned. Because struct slab currently just reinterprets the
 * bits of struct page, we align all struct pages to double-word boundaries,
 * and ensure that 'freelist' is aligned within struct slab.

 *
 * (c) !ALLOW_RETRY and !TRIED: this means the page fault does not allow retry
 *
 * The unlisted combination (!ALLOW_RETRY && TRIED) is illegal and should never
 * be used.  Note that page faults can be allowed to retry for multiple times,
 * in which case we'll have an initial fault with flags (a) then later on
 * continuous faults with flags (b).  We should always try to detect pending
 * signals before a retry to make sure the continuous page faults can still be
 * interrupted if necessary.
 *
 * The combination FAULT_FLAG_WRITE|FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE is illegal.
 * FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE is ignored and treated like an ordinary read fault when
 * applied to mappings that are not COW mappings.

/*
 * FOLL_PIN and FOLL_LONGTERM may be used in various combinations with each
 * other. Here is what they mean, and how to use them:
 *
 *
 * FIXME: For pages which are part of a filesystem, mappings are subject to the
 * lifetime enforced by the filesystem and we need guarantees that longterm
 * users like RDMA and V4L2 only establish mappings which coordinate usage with
 * the filesystem.  Ideas for this coordination include revoking the longterm
 * pin, delaying writeback, bounce buffer page writeback, etc.  As FS DAX was
 * added after the problem with filesystems was found FS DAX VMAs are
 * specifically failed.  Filesystem pages are still subject to bugs and use of
 * FOLL_LONGTERM should be avoided on those pages.
 *
 * In the CMA case: long term pins in a CMA region would unnecessarily fragment
 * that region.  And so, CMA attempts to migrate the page before pinning, when
 * FOLL_LONGTERM is specified.
 *
 * FOLL_PIN indicates that a special kind of tracking (not just page->_refcount,
 * but an additional pin counting system) will be invoked. This is intended for
 * anything that gets a page reference and then touches page data (for example,
 * Direct IO). This lets the filesystem know that some non-file-system entity is
 * potentially changing the pages' data. In contrast to FOLL_GET (whose pages
 * are released via put_page()), FOLL_PIN pages must be released, ultimately, by
 * a call to unpin_user_page().
 *
 * FOLL_PIN is similar to FOLL_GET: both of these pin pages. They use different
 * and separate refcounting mechanisms, however, and that means that each has
 * its own acquire and release mechanisms:
 *
 *     FOLL_GET: get_user_pages*() to acquire, and put_page() to release.
 *
 *     FOLL_PIN: pin_user_pages*() to acquire, and unpin_user_pages to release.
 *
 * FOLL_PIN and FOLL_GET are mutually exclusive for a given function call.
 * (The underlying pages may experience both FOLL_GET-based and FOLL_PIN-based
 * calls applied to them, and that's perfectly OK. This is a constraint on the
 * callers, not on the pages.)
 *
 * FOLL_PIN should be set internally by the pin_user_pages*() APIs, never
 * directly by the caller. That's in order to help avoid mismatches when
 * releasing pages: get_user_pages*() pages must be released via put_page(),
 * while pin_user_pages*() pages must be released via unpin_user_page().
 *
 * Please see Documentation/core-api/pin_user_pages.rst for more information.
