/**
 * struct power_supply_maintenance_charge_table - setting for maintenace charging
 * @charge_current_max_ua: maintenance charging current that is used to keep
 *   the charge of the battery full as current is consumed after full charging.
 *   The corresponding charge_voltage_max_uv is used as a safeguard: when we
 *   reach this voltage the maintenance charging current is turned off. It is
 *   turned back on if we fall below this voltage.
 * @charge_voltage_max_uv: maintenance charging voltage that is usually a bit
 *   lower than the constant_charge_voltage_max_uv. We can apply this settings
 *   charge_current_max_ua until we get back up to this voltage.
 * @safety_timer_minutes: maintenance charging safety timer, with an expiry
 *   time in minutes. We will only use maintenance charging in this setting
 *   for a certain amount of time, then we will first move to the next
 *   maintenance charge current and voltage pair in respective array and wait
 *   for the next safety timer timeout, or, if we reached the last maintencance
 *   charging setting, disable charging until we reach
 *   charge_restart_voltage_uv and restart ordinary CC/CV charging from there.
 *   These timers should be chosen to align with the typical discharge curve
 *   for the battery.
 *
 * Ordinary CC/CV charging will stop charging when the charge current goes
 * below charge_term_current_ua, and then restart it (if the device is still
 * plugged into the charger) at charge_restart_voltage_uv. This happens in most
 * consumer products because the power usage while connected to a charger is
 * not zero, and devices are not manufactured to draw power directly from the
 * charger: instead they will at all times dissipate the battery a little, like
 * the power used in standby mode. This will over time give a charge graph
 * such as this:
 *
 * Energy
 *  ^      ...        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...
 *  |    .   .       .  .     .  .     .  .     .  .     .  .     .
 *  |  ..     .   ..     .  ..    .  ..    .  ..    .  ..    .  ..
 *  |.          ..        ..       ..       ..       ..       ..
 *  +-------------------------------------------------------------------> t
 *
 * Practically this means that the Li-ions are wandering back and forth in the
 * battery and this causes degeneration of the battery anode and cathode.
 * To prolong the life of the battery, maintenance charging is applied after
 * reaching charge_term_current_ua to hold up the charge in the battery while
 * consuming power, thus lowering the wear on the battery:
 *
 * Energy
 *  ^      .......................................
 *  |    .                                        ......................
 *  |  ..
 *  |.
 *  +-------------------------------------------------------------------> t
 *
 * Maintenance charging uses the voltages from this table: a table of settings
 * is traversed using a slightly lower current and voltage than what is used for
 * CC/CV charging. The maintenance charging will for safety reasons not go on
 * indefinately: we lower the current and voltage with successive maintenance
 * settings, then disable charging completely after we reach the last one,
 * and after that we do not restart charging until we reach
 * charge_restart_voltage_uv (see struct power_supply_battery_info) and restart
 * ordinary CC/CV charging from there.
 *
 * As an example, a Samsung EB425161LA Lithium-Ion battery is CC/CV charged
 * at 900mA to 4340mV, then maintenance charged at 600mA and 4150mV for up to
 * 60 hours, then maintenance charged at 600mA and 4100mV for up to 200 hours.
 * After this the charge cycle is restarted waiting for
 * charge_restart_voltage_uv.
 *
 * For most mobile electronics this type of maintenance charging is enough for
 * the user to disconnect the device and make use of it before both maintenance
 * charging cycles are complete, if the current and voltage has been chosen
 * appropriately. These need to be determined from battery discharge curves
 * and expected standby current.
 *
 * If the voltage anyway drops to charge_restart_voltage_uv during maintenance
 * charging, ordinary CC/CV charging is restarted. This can happen if the
 * device is e.g. actively used during charging, so more current is drawn than
 * the expected stand-by current. Also overvoltage protection will be applied
 * as usual.

 * @energy_full_design_uwh: energy content when fully charged in microwatt
 *   hours
 * @charge_full_design_uah: charge content when fully charged in microampere
 *   hours
 * @voltage_min_design_uv: minimum voltage across the poles when the battery
 *   is at minimum voltage level in microvolts. If the voltage drops below this
 *   level the battery will need precharging when using CC/CV charging.
 * @voltage_max_design_uv: voltage across the poles when the battery is fully
 *   charged in microvolts. This is the "nominal voltage" i.e. the voltage
 *   printed on the label of the battery.
 * @tricklecharge_current_ua: the tricklecharge current used when trickle
 *   charging the battery in microamperes. This is the charging phase when the
 *   battery is completely empty and we need to carefully trickle in some
 *   charge until we reach the precharging voltage.
 * @precharge_current_ua: current to use in the precharge phase in microamperes,
 *   the precharge rate is limited by limiting the current to this value.
 * @precharge_voltage_max_uv: the maximum voltage allowed when precharging in
 *   microvolts. When we pass this voltage we will nominally switch over to the
 *   CC (constant current) charging phase defined by constant_charge_current_ua
 *   and constant_charge_voltage_max_uv.
 * @charge_term_current_ua: when the current in the CV (constant voltage)
 *   charging phase drops below this value in microamperes the charging will
 *   terminate completely and not restart until the voltage over the battery
 *   poles reach charge_restart_voltage_uv unless we use maintenance charging.
 * @charge_restart_voltage_uv: when the battery has been fully charged by
 *   CC/CV charging and charging has been disabled, and the voltage subsequently
 *   drops below this value in microvolts, the charging will be restarted
 *   (typically using CV charging).
 * @overvoltage_limit_uv: If the voltage exceeds the nominal voltage
 *   voltage_max_design_uv and we reach this voltage level, all charging must
 *   stop and emergency procedures take place, such as shutting down the system
 *   in some cases.
 * @constant_charge_current_max_ua: current in microamperes to use in the CC
 *   (constant current) charging phase. The charging rate is limited
 *   by this current. This is the main charging phase and as the current is
 *   constant into the battery the voltage slowly ascends to
 *   constant_charge_voltage_max_uv.
 * @constant_charge_voltage_max_uv: voltage in microvolts signifying the end of
 *   the CC (constant current) charging phase and the beginning of the CV
 *   (constant voltage) charging phase.
 * @maintenance_charge: an array of maintenance charging settings to be used
 *   after the main CC/CV charging phase is complete.
 * @maintenance_charge_size: the number of maintenance charging settings in
 *   maintenance_charge.
 * @alert_low_temp_charge_current_ua: The charging current to use if the battery
 *   enters low alert temperature, i.e. if the internal temperature is between
 *   temp_alert_min and temp_min. No matter the charging phase, this
 *   and alert_high_temp_charge_voltage_uv will be applied.
 * @alert_low_temp_charge_voltage_uv: Same as alert_low_temp_charge_current_ua,
 *   but for the charging voltage.
 * @alert_high_temp_charge_current_ua: The charging current to use if the
 *   battery enters high alert temperature, i.e. if the internal temperature is
 *   between temp_alert_max and temp_max. No matter the charging phase, this
 *   and alert_high_temp_charge_voltage_uv will be applied, usually lowering
 *   the charging current as an evasive manouver.
 * @alert_high_temp_charge_voltage_uv: Same as
 *   alert_high_temp_charge_current_ua, but for the charging voltage.
 * @factory_internal_resistance_uohm: the internal resistance of the battery
 *   at fabrication time, expressed in microohms. This resistance will vary
 *   depending on the lifetime and charge of the battery, so this is just a
 *   nominal ballpark figure. This internal resistance is given for the state
 *   when the battery is discharging.
 * @factory_internal_resistance_charging_uohm: the internal resistance of the
 *   battery at fabrication time while charging, expressed in microohms.
 *   The charging process will affect the internal resistance of the battery
 *   so this value provides a better resistance under these circumstances.
 *   This resistance will vary depending on the lifetime and charge of the
 *   battery, so this is just a nominal ballpark figure.
 * @ocv_temp: array indicating the open circuit voltage (OCV) capacity
 *   temperature indices. This is an array of temperatures in degrees Celsius
 *   indicating which capacity table to use for a certain temperature, since
 *   the capacity for reasons of chemistry will be different at different
 *   temperatures. Determining capacity is a multivariate problem and the
 *   temperature is the first variable we determine.
 * @temp_ambient_alert_min: the battery will go outside of operating conditions
 *   when the ambient temperature goes below this temperature in degrees
 *   Celsius.
 * @temp_ambient_alert_max: the battery will go outside of operating conditions
 *   when the ambient temperature goes above this temperature in degrees
 *   Celsius.
 * @temp_alert_min: the battery should issue an alert if the internal
 *   temperature goes below this temperature in degrees Celsius.
 * @temp_alert_max: the battery should issue an alert if the internal
 *   temperature goes above this temperature in degrees Celsius.
 * @temp_min: the battery will go outside of operating conditions when
 *   the internal temperature goes below this temperature in degrees Celsius.
 *   Normally this means the system should shut down.
 * @temp_max: the battery will go outside of operating conditions when
 *   the internal temperature goes above this temperature in degrees Celsius.
 *   Normally this means the system should shut down.
 * @ocv_table: for each entry in ocv_temp there is a corresponding entry in
 *   ocv_table and a size for each entry in ocv_table_size. These arrays
 *   determine the capacity in percent in relation to the voltage in microvolts
 *   at the indexed temperature.
 * @ocv_table_size: for each entry in ocv_temp this array is giving the size of
 *   each entry in the array of capacity arrays in ocv_table.
 * @resist_table: this is a table that correlates a battery temperature to the
 *   expected internal resistance at this temperature. The resistance is given
 *   as a percentage of factory_internal_resistance_uohm. Knowing the
 *   resistance of the battery is usually necessary for calculating the open
 *   circuit voltage (OCV) that is then used with the ocv_table to calculate
 *   the capacity of the battery. The resist_table must be ordered descending
 *   by temperature: highest temperature with lowest resistance first, lowest
 *   temperature with highest resistance last.
 * @resist_table_size: the number of items in the resist_table.
 * @vbat2ri_discharging: this is a table that correlates Battery voltage (VBAT)
 *   to internal resistance (Ri). The resistance is given in microohm for the
 *   corresponding voltage in microvolts. The internal resistance is used to
 *   determine the open circuit voltage so that we can determine the capacity
 *   of the battery. These voltages to resistance tables apply when the battery
 *   is discharging. The table must be ordered descending by voltage: highest
 *   voltage first.
 * @vbat2ri_discharging_size: the number of items in the vbat2ri_discharging
 *   table.
 * @vbat2ri_charging: same function as vbat2ri_discharging but for the state
 *   when the battery is charging. Being under charge changes the battery's
 *   internal resistance characteristics so a separate table is needed.*
 *   The table must be ordered descending by voltage: highest voltage first.
 * @vbat2ri_charging_size: the number of items in the vbat2ri_charging
 *   table.
 * @bti_resistance_ohm: The Battery Type Indicator (BIT) nominal resistance
 *   in ohms for this battery, if an identification resistor is mounted
 *   between a third battery terminal and ground. This scheme is used by a lot
 *   of mobile device batteries.
 * @bti_resistance_tolerance: The tolerance in percent of the BTI resistance,
 *   for example 10 for +/- 10%, if the bti_resistance is set to 7000 and the
 *   tolerance is 10% we will detect a proper battery if the BTI resistance
 *   is between 6300 and 7700 Ohm.

 * +-----------------------------------------------------------------> time
 *
 * These diagrams are synchronized on time and the voltage and current
 * follow each other.
 *
 * With CC/CV charging commence over time like this for an empty battery:
 *
 * 1. When the battery is completely empty it may need to be charged with
 *    an especially small current so that electrons just "trickle in",
 *    this is the tricklecharge_current_ua.
 *
 * 2. Next a small initial pre-charge current (precharge_current_ua)
 *    is applied if the voltage is below precharge_voltage_max_uv until we
 *    reach precharge_voltage_max_uv. CAUTION: in some texts this is referred
 *    to as "trickle charging" but the use in the Linux kernel is different
 *    see below!
 *
 * 3. Then the main charging current is applied, which is called the constant
 *    current (CC) phase. A current regulator is set up to allow
 *    constant_charge_current_max_ua of current to flow into the battery.
 *    The chemical reaction in the battery will make the voltage go up as
 *    charge goes into the battery. This current is applied until we reach
 *    the constant_charge_voltage_max_uv voltage.
 *
 * 4. At this voltage we switch over to the constant voltage (CV) phase. This
 *    means we allow current to go into the battery, but we keep the voltage
 *    fixed. This current will continue to charge the battery while keeping
 *    the voltage the same. A chemical reaction in the battery goes on
 *    storing energy without affecting the voltage. Over time the current
 *    will slowly drop and when we reach charge_term_current_ua we will
 *    end the constant voltage phase.
 *
 * After this the battery is fully charged, and if we do not support maintenance
 * charging, the charging will not restart until power dissipation makes the
 * voltage fall so that we reach charge_restart_voltage_uv and at this point
 * we restart charging at the appropriate phase, usually this will be inside
 * the CV phase.
 *
 * If we support maintenance charging the voltage is however kept high after
 * the CV phase with a very low current. This is meant to let the same charge
 * go in for usage while the charger is still connected, mainly for
 * dissipation for the power consuming entity while connected to the
 * charger.
 *
 * All charging MUST terminate if the overvoltage_limit_uv is ever reached.
 * Overcharging Lithium Ion cells can be DANGEROUS and lead to fire or
 * explosions.
 *
 * DETERMINING BATTERY CAPACITY:
 *
 * Several members of the struct deal with trying to determine the remaining
 * capacity in the battery, usually as a percentage of charge. In practice
 * many chargers uses a so-called fuel gauge or coloumb counter that measure
 * how much charge goes into the battery and how much goes out (+/- leak
 * consumption). This does not help if we do not know how much capacity the
 * battery has to begin with, such as when it is first used or was taken out
 * and charged in a separate charger. Therefore many capacity algorithms use
 * the open circuit voltage with a look-up table to determine the rough
 * capacity of the battery. The open circuit voltage can be conceptualized
 * with an ideal voltage source (V) in series with an internal resistance (Ri)
 * like this:
 *
 *      +-------> IBAT >----------------+
 *      |                    ^          |
 *     [ ] Ri                |          |
 *      |                    | VBAT     |
 *      o <----------        |          |
 *     +|           ^        |         [ ] Rload
 *    .---.         |        |          |
 *    | V |         | OCV    |          |
 *    '---'         |        |          |
 *      |           |        |          |
 *  GND +-------------------------------+
 *
 * If we disconnect the load (here simplified as a fixed resistance Rload)
 * and measure VBAT with a infinite impedance voltage meter we will get
 * VBAT = OCV and this assumption is sometimes made even under load, assuming
 * Rload is insignificant. However this will be of dubious quality because the
 * load is rarely that small and Ri is strongly nonlinear depending on
 * temperature and how much capacity is left in the battery due to the
 * chemistry involved.
 *
 * In many practical applications we cannot just disconnect the battery from
 * the load, so instead we often try to measure the instantaneous IBAT (the
 * current out from the battery), estimate the Ri and thus calculate the
 * voltage drop over Ri and compensate like this:
 *
 *   OCV = VBAT - (IBAT * Ri)
 *
 * The tables vbat2ri_discharging and vbat2ri_charging are used to determine
 * (by interpolation) the Ri from the VBAT under load. These curves are highly
 * nonlinear and may need many datapoints but can be found in datasheets for
 * some batteries. This gives the compensated open circuit voltage (OCV) for
 * the battery even under load. Using this method will also compensate for
 * temperature changes in the environment: this will also make the internal
 * resistance change, and it will affect the VBAT under load, so correlating
 * VBAT to Ri takes both remaining capacity and temperature into consideration.
 *
 * Alternatively a manufacturer can specify how the capacity of the battery
 * is dependent on the battery temperature which is the main factor affecting
 * Ri. As we know all checmical reactions are faster when it is warm and slower
 * when it is cold. You can put in 1500mAh and only get 800mAh out before the
 * voltage drops too low for example. This effect is also highly nonlinear and
 * the purpose of the table resist_table: this will take a temperature and
 * tell us how big percentage of Ri the specified temperature correlates to.
 * Usually we have 100% of the factory_internal_resistance_uohm at 25 degrees
 * Celsius.
 *
 * The power supply class itself doesn't use this struct as of now.
