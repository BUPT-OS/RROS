/// [`std::dbg`], but using [`pr_info`] instead of [`eprintln`].
///
/// Prints and returns the value of a given expression for quick and dirty
/// debugging.
///
/// An example:
///
/// ```rust
/// let a = 2;
/// # #[allow(clippy::dbg_macro)]
/// let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
/// //      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4
/// assert_eq!(b, 5);
/// ```
///
/// The macro works by using the `Debug` implementation of the type of
/// the given expression to print the value with [`printk`] along with the
/// source location of the macro invocation as well as the source code
/// of the expression.
///
/// Invoking the macro on an expression moves and takes ownership of it
/// before returning the evaluated expression unchanged. If the type
/// of the expression does not implement `Copy` and you don't want
/// to give up ownership, you can instead borrow with `dbg!(&expr)`
/// for some expression `expr`.
///
/// The `dbg!` macro works exactly the same in release builds.
/// This is useful when debugging issues that only occur in release
/// builds or when debugging in release mode is significantly faster.
///
/// Note that the macro is intended as a temporary debugging tool to be
/// used during development. Therefore, avoid committing `dbg!` macro
/// invocations into the kernel tree.
///
/// For debug output that is intended to be kept in the kernel tree,
/// use [`pr_debug`] and similar facilities instead.
///
/// # Stability
///
/// The exact output printed by this macro should not be relied upon
/// and is subject to future changes.
///
/// # Further examples
///
/// With a method call:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[allow(clippy::dbg_macro)]
/// fn foo(n: usize) {
///     if dbg!(n.checked_sub(4)).is_some() {
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
///
/// foo(3)
/// ```
///
/// This prints to the kernel log:
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// [src/main.rs:4] n.checked_sub(4) = None
/// ```
///
/// Naive factorial implementation:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[allow(clippy::dbg_macro)]
/// # {
/// fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
///     if dbg!(n <= 1) {
///         dbg!(1)
///     } else {
///         dbg!(n * factorial(n - 1))
///     }
/// }
///
/// dbg!(factorial(4));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This prints to the kernel log:
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// [src/main.rs:3] n <= 1 = false
/// [src/main.rs:3] n <= 1 = false
/// [src/main.rs:3] n <= 1 = false
/// [src/main.rs:3] n <= 1 = true
/// [src/main.rs:4] 1 = 1
/// [src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 2
/// [src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 6
/// [src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 24
/// [src/main.rs:11] factorial(4) = 24
/// ```
///
/// The `dbg!(..)` macro moves the input:
///
/// ```ignore
/// /// A wrapper around `usize` which importantly is not Copyable.
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct NoCopy(usize);
///
/// let a = NoCopy(42);
/// let _ = dbg!(a); // <-- `a` is moved here.
/// let _ = dbg!(a); // <-- `a` is moved again; error!
/// ```
///
/// You can also use `dbg!()` without a value to just print the
/// file and line whenever it's reached.
///
/// Finally, if you want to `dbg!(..)` multiple values, it will treat them as
/// a tuple (and return it, too):
///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(clippy::dbg_macro)]
/// assert_eq!(dbg!(1usize, 2u32), (1, 2));
/// ```
///
/// However, a single argument with a trailing comma will still not be treated
/// as a tuple, following the convention of ignoring trailing commas in macro
/// invocations. You can use a 1-tuple directly if you need one:
///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(clippy::dbg_macro)]
/// # {
/// assert_eq!(1, dbg!(1u32,)); // trailing comma ignored
/// assert_eq!((1,), dbg!((1u32,))); // 1-tuple
/// # }
/// ```
