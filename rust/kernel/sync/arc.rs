//! A reference-counted pointer.
//!
//! This module implements a way for users to create reference-counted objects and pointers to
//! them. Such a pointer automatically increments and decrements the count, and drops the
//! underlying object when it reaches zero. It is also safe to use concurrently from multiple
//! threads.
//!
//! It is different from the standard library's [`Arc`] in a few ways:
//! 1. It is backed by the kernel's `refcount_t` type.
//! 2. It does not support weak references, which allows it to be half the size.
//! 3. It saturates the reference count instead of aborting when it goes over a threshold.
//! 4. It does not provide a `get_mut` method, so the ref counted object is pinned.
//!
