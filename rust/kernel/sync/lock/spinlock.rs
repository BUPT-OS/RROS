/// A spinlock.
///
/// Exposes the kernel's [`spinlock_t`]. When multiple CPUs attempt to lock the same spinlock, only
/// one at a time is allowed to progress, the others will block (spinning) until the spinlock is
/// unlocked, at which point another CPU will be allowed to make progress.
///
/// Instances of [`SpinLock`] need a lock class and to be pinned. The recommended way to create such
/// instances is with the [`pin_init`](crate::pin_init) and [`new_spinlock`] macros.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The following example shows how to declare, allocate and initialise a struct (`Example`) that
/// contains an inner struct (`Inner`) that is protected by a spinlock.
///
/// ```
/// use kernel::{init::InPlaceInit, init::PinInit, new_spinlock, pin_init, sync::SpinLock};
///
/// struct Inner {
///     a: u32,
///     b: u32,
/// }
///
/// #[pin_data]
/// struct Example {
///     c: u32,
///     #[pin]
///     d: SpinLock<Inner>,
/// }
///
/// impl Example {
///     fn new() -> impl PinInit<Self> {
///         pin_init!(Self {
///             c: 10,
///             d <- new_spinlock!(Inner { a: 20, b: 30 }),
///         })
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Allocate a boxed `Example`.
/// let e = Box::pin_init(Example::new())?;
/// assert_eq!(e.c, 10);
/// assert_eq!(e.d.lock().a, 20);
/// assert_eq!(e.d.lock().b, 30);
/// # Ok::<(), Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// The following example shows how to use interior mutability to modify the contents of a struct
/// protected by a spinlock despite only having a shared reference:
///
/// ```
/// use kernel::sync::SpinLock;
///
/// struct Example {
///     a: u32,
///     b: u32,
/// }
///
/// fn example(m: &SpinLock<Example>) {
///     let mut guard = m.lock();
///     guard.a += 10;
///     guard.b += 20;
/// }
/// ```
