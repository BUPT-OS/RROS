//! Work queues.
//!
//! This file has two components: The raw work item API, and the safe work item API.
//!
//! One pattern that is used in both APIs is the `ID` const generic, which exists to allow a single
//! type to define multiple `work_struct` fields. This is done by choosing an id for each field,
//! and using that id to specify which field you wish to use. (The actual value doesn't matter, as
//! long as you use different values for different fields of the same struct.) Since these IDs are
//! generic, they are used only at compile-time, so they shouldn't exist in the final binary.
//!
//! # The raw API
//!
//! The raw API consists of the [`RawWorkItem`] trait, where the work item needs to provide an
//! arbitrary function that knows how to enqueue the work item. It should usually not be used
//! directly, but if you want to, you can use it without using the pieces from the safe API.
//!
//! # The safe API
//!
//! The safe API is used via the [`Work`] struct and [`WorkItem`] traits. Furthermore, it also
//! includes a trait called [`WorkItemPointer`], which is usually not used directly by the user.
//!
//!  * The [`Work`] struct is the Rust wrapper for the C `work_struct` type.
//!  * The [`WorkItem`] trait is implemented for structs that can be enqueued to a workqueue.
//!  * The [`WorkItemPointer`] trait is implemented for the pointer type that points at a something
//!    that implements [`WorkItem`].
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! This example defines a struct that holds an integer and can be scheduled on the workqueue. When
//! the struct is executed, it will print the integer. Since there is only one `work_struct` field,
//! we do not need to specify ids for the fields.
//!
//! ```
//! use kernel::prelude::*;
//! use kernel::sync::Arc;
//! use kernel::workqueue::{self, impl_has_work, new_work, Work, WorkItem};
//!
//! #[pin_data]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     value: i32,
//!     #[pin]
//!     work: Work<MyStruct>,
//! }
//!
//! impl_has_work! {
//!     impl HasWork<Self> for MyStruct { self.work }
//! }
//!
//! impl MyStruct {
//!     fn new(value: i32) -> Result<Arc<Self>> {
//!         Arc::pin_init(pin_init!(MyStruct {
//!             value,
//!             work <- new_work!("MyStruct::work"),
//!         }))
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl WorkItem for MyStruct {
//!     type Pointer = Arc<MyStruct>;
//!
//!     fn run(this: Arc<MyStruct>) {
//!         pr_info!("The value is: {}", this.value);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /// This method will enqueue the struct for execution on the system workqueue, where its value
//! /// will be printed.
//! fn print_later(val: Arc<MyStruct>) {
//!     let _ = workqueue::system().enqueue(val);
//! }
