config SECURITY_SELINUX
	bool "SELinux Support"
	depends on SECURITY_NETWORK && AUDIT && NET && INET
	select NETWORK_SECMARK
	default n
	help
	  This selects Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
	  You will also need a policy configuration and a labeled filesystem.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM
	bool "SELinux boot parameter"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option adds a kernel parameter 'selinux', which allows SELinux
	  to be disabled at boot.  If this option is selected, SELinux
	  functionality can be disabled with selinux=0 on the kernel
	  command line.  The purpose of this option is to allow a single
	  kernel image to be distributed with SELinux built in, but not
	  necessarily enabled.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP
	bool "SELinux Development Support"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This enables the development support option of SELinux,
	  which is useful for experimenting with SELinux and developing
	  policies.  If unsure, say Y.  With this option enabled, the
	  kernel will start in permissive mode (log everything, deny nothing)
	  unless you specify enforcing=1 on the kernel command line.  You
	  can interactively toggle the kernel between enforcing mode and
	  permissive mode (if permitted by the policy) via
	  /sys/fs/selinux/enforce.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_AVC_STATS
	bool "SELinux AVC Statistics"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This option collects access vector cache statistics to
	  /sys/fs/selinux/avc/cache_stats, which may be monitored via
	  tools such as avcstat.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_SIDTAB_HASH_BITS
	int "SELinux sidtab hashtable size"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	range 8 13
	default 9
	help
	  This option sets the number of buckets used in the sidtab hashtable
	  to 2^SECURITY_SELINUX_SIDTAB_HASH_BITS buckets. The number of hash
	  collisions may be viewed at /sys/fs/selinux/ss/sidtab_hash_stats. If
	  chain lengths are high (e.g. > 20) then selecting a higher value here
	  will ensure that lookups times are short and stable.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_SID2STR_CACHE_SIZE
	int "SELinux SID to context string translation cache size"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default 256
	help
	  This option defines the size of the internal SID -> context string
	  cache, which improves the performance of context to string
	  conversion.  Setting this option to 0 disables the cache completely.

	  If unsure, keep the default value.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DEBUG
	bool "SELinux kernel debugging support"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This enables debugging code designed to help SELinux kernel
	  developers, unless you know what this does in the kernel code you
	  should leave this disabled.
