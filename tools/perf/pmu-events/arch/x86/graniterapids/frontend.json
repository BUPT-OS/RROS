Common examples include instruction cache misses or x86 instruction decode limitations.\nThe count may be distributed among unhalted logical processors (hyper-threads) who share the same physical core, in processors that support Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. Software can use this event as the numerator for the Frontend Bound metric (or top-level category) of the Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis method.",
