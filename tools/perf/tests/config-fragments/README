This folder is for kernel config fragments that can be merged with
defconfig to give full test coverage of a perf test run. This is only
an optimistic set as some features require hardware support in order to
pass and not skip.

'config' is shared across all platforms, and for arch specific files,
the file name should match that used in the ARCH=... make option.
