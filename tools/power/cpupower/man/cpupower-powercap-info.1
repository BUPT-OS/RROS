.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcpupower powercap-info \fP shows kernel powercapping subsystem information.
This needs hardware support and a loaded powercapping driver (at this time only
intel_rapl driver exits) exporting hardware values userspace via sysfs.

Some options are platform wide, some affect single cores. By default values
of core zero are displayed only. cpupower --cpu all cpuinfo will show the
settings of all cores, see cpupower(1) how to choose specific cores.
